pdfdragondrop
=============

A JavaFX window where you can drag .doc files onto to get them converted to pdf

You need to have openoffice or libreoffice installed in order to make this work. But once you do it works rally well.

Ah. You need java7 and you need to start the application from commandline specifying the jfxrt.jar for now. Until I or Oracle figures out a smarter way to do this. Might be better in java8?
